# 💝 "Will You Be My Valentine?" Interactive Website

## Overview
A romantic, playful Valentine's-themed website that asks "Will you be my Valentine?" with two buttons — **Yes** and **No**. The **No** button is impossible to click (it runs away!), and clicking **Yes** triggers a celebration.

## Page Flow

### 1. Landing / Hero Section
- Beautiful Valentine's theme with floating hearts animation in the background
- Soft pink/red gradient background with subtle sparkle effects
- A cute headline like *"Hey, I have something to ask you..."*
- A heart or love-themed illustration/emoji centerpiece
- Smooth scroll or button to reveal the question

### 2. The Big Question
- Large, romantic text: **"Will you be my Valentine? 💕"**
- Two buttons: **"Yes! 💖"** and **"No 😢"**

### 3. The Mischievous "No" Button
- Every time the user tries to hover or click "No", the button **jumps to a random position** on the screen
- Each failed attempt shows a **teasing message**, cycling through lines like:
  - "Are you sure? 🥺"
  - "Think again... 💔"
  - "You're breaking my heart!"
  - "That's not the right answer!"
  - "Try again, cutie 😏"
  - "Nope, not an option!"
  - "My heart can't take this!"
- The "Yes" button **grows slightly bigger** with each failed "No" attempt, making it even more obvious 😄
- The "No" button gets **smaller** each time it escapes

### 4. The "Yes" Celebration 🎉
- Clicking **Yes** triggers:
  - A **confetti/party popper animation** filling the screen
  - Floating hearts explosion
  - A sweet message appears: *"Yay! You just made me the happiest person in the world! 💕🥰"*
  - Background changes to a warm, glowing romantic theme
  - Maybe a cute animated heart beating effect

## Design & Theme
- **Color palette**: Soft pinks, reds, and whites with gold accents
- **Typography**: Playful, romantic fonts (using Google Fonts)
- **Animations**: Floating hearts, gentle pulse effects, smooth transitions
- **Mobile responsive**: Works beautifully on phones (likely how the valentine will open it!)

## Technical Notes
- Pure frontend — no backend needed
- Custom CSS animations for floating hearts and confetti
- Fun, lightweight, and fast-loading
